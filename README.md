## Router Configuration

The application uses React Router for navigation.  The main routes are defined in `router.ts` (or `router.js`) and include:

* `/`:  The main application layout, defined in `App.tsx`.
* `/explore`: The page displaying the products, implemented in `explore.tsx`.
* Other routes:  \[List any other routes and their corresponding components, e.g., product details page (`/product/:id`), etc.]

## Component Structure

* `App.tsx`:  The main application container.  It includes the header, main content area (using `Outlet` for nested routes), and footer.
* `main.tsx`:  The entry point of the application.  It renders the `App` component within a React StrictMode.
* `components/header`:  The header component provides navigation across the website.
* `components/Footer`:  The footer component displays copyright information and other relevant links.
* `components/SearchBar.tsx`:  Provides the search bar functionality, allowing users to search by product name or store and filter by price.
* `pages/explore.tsx`:  Displays the product listing, search bar, and handles product fetching and display logic.
* `components/ProductCard.tsx`:  [If you have this component, describe it.  If not, describe how products are displayed] Displays individual product information.
* `router.ts`:  Configures the application's routes using React Router.
